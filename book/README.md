# Backbone music player
My the biggest application wrote in backbone 

## How does it work
* you can add url for mp3 track (when you add track you can use random solution for add url for some random music)
* you can search on added tracks
* three categories (all tracks, favorite, category [category of added tracks])
* recently listened list - sorted by last tracks 
* in main section you can play track, edit or delete or add for favorite

## Link for application

## TODO
* fix some small bugs - sometimes player not start when you click fast
